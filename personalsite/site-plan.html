      <h3>Awesome Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you are trying to deal the most damage in the least amount of turns, or you are trying to sneak past some pirates to get a treasure unnoticed, character5e will help you optimize that build. Perhaps you would like to track an enemy or gather information instead of sneaking and fighting, our site will help you. If your goal is to simply have fun playing the game, however, our site will recommend fun characters from literature that you can theme your character creation around.
        Character creation revolves around six different stats: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength allows a character to hit harder and deal more damage with weapons. Dexterity is how nimble your character is, or how easy it is for it to evade oncoming attacks. Constitution defines how much health points your character has. Intelligence allows your character to cast spells and to know things in game. Wisdom shows how aware your character is of its surroundings. Charisma allows your character to make friends and be sociable.

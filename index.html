            <p>Hello fellow classmates! I don't really have a nickname, but I'm studying for a BS on Applied Technology, and I hope to become a Web Developer.
                I love to play sports and to be active; soccer, tennis, and volleyball are among my favorite sports. I also love eating marshmallows.
                I'm currently working as a surveyor assistant to help pay for school, but I want to dive into the Web Development career as soon as 
                possible. The advantages of learning about careers in  Web Design are many. The reason that appeals to me the most is that there are opportunities 
                to work from home. ;P
            </p>
            <p>I'm super excited to learn with you all this semester!</p>
